* **Inventory Audit Module:** Dedicated workflow for periodic physical counting and reconciliation.
* **Smart Categorization:** Custom data fields tailored for both Laptops and Handheld devices.
* **Simplified Check-in/Check-out:** A user-friendly interface for assigning devices to specific employees instantly.
